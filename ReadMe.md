# NOTE: please switch to [the grab-o-scope project](https://github.com/rdpoor/grab-o-scope).

_As of November 2024, this repository will no longer be updated. 
It has been superseded by the [grab-o-scope project](https://github.com/rdpoor/grab-o-scope) 
which now provides support for multiple oscilloscopes, including the Rigol DS1054Z and 
the Rigol DHO924.  Head on over there, and thank you for your support!_

_Capture Rigol DS1054Z Oscilloscope Display as a .png file, for MacOS,
Linux and Windows_

The Rigol DS1054Z Oscilloscope is a powerful multi-channel tool for the
hobbyist and professional alike.  It includes a USB port, but there's not
much in the way of software support for Linux and macOS systems.

rigol_grab is a cross-platform Python-based script that lets you capture the
contents of the Rigol Oscilloscope display to a .png file via USB or Ethernet connection, such as this:

![Rigol Screen Capture](/rigol.png)

## Setup

The setup process assumes you already have `git`, `Python` and `pipenv` set up
on your machine.  In a shell window:

    > cd <your chosen directory>
    > git clone https://github.com/rdpoor/rigol-grab.git
    > cd rigol-grab
    > pipenv install

## Running rigol_grab

First, plug the Rigol 'scope into your computer via USB cable or connect it to your network and note its IP address.  Then, in a shell window use these commands for a USB connection:

    > cd <your chosen directory>/rigol-grab
    > pipenv shell
    > python rigol_grab.py --auto_view

Or use these commands for an Ethernet connection (substitute your Rigol's own IP address):

    > cd <your chosen directory>/rigol-grab
    > pipenv shell
    > python rigol_grab.py --auto_view --port 127.0.0.1

Note that the `--auto_view` argument will cause the .png file to be opened immediately using the default viewer for your system.

## Options

`rigol_grab.py` accepts command line arguments:

    --verbose: print additional information
    --filename <filename.png>: specify the pathname of the saved .png file (default: rigol.png)
    --auto_view: automatically open the .png using your system viewer
    --port: IP address of the oscilloscope if using Ethernet instead of USB

 ## Caveats

 There are a few known bugs.  Top scientists are investigating these issues and
 hope to have a fix.  Or you can propose a fix with a pull request:

 * The program always throws an error upon exiting.  This appears to be benign.
 * Once every two or three times, the .png data is corrupted.  If this happens,
 just re-run the script.
 * There's been zero testing on Linux systems.  But it might work.
